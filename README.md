# Learning MATLAB: Beginning Scientific Computing

This report contains an overview of my work in completing MATH 3607, BeginningScientific Computing, a course specializing in the programming and numeric computing platform MATLAB at The Ohio State University during the Spring of 2023. The course was designed as an introduction to the mathematical theory of algorithms used to solve
problems that typically arise in sciences, engineering, and finance. Specifically, several key concepts taught in this course are applicable to the main responsibilities of actuaries, data scientists, and other quantitative thinkers.

My purpose in presenting this document publicly is to showcase my experience in utilizing statistical software to solve complex mathematical problems via numerical computations. In addition, given the complexity of the mathematics involved, I hope to reduce each problem into a digestible form for a non-technical reader to understand, as this kind of conceptual simiplification is necessary when communicating with others in the professional world.

It is worthy to note that the programming language R is more commonly used in the actuarial profession for data-driven calculations and analysis. However, it and MATLAB
share many commonalities. In particular, both
- are used for numerical computations,
- support functional programming,
- support array programming (vectorized operations),
- allow plotting of functions and data, and
- allow implementation of algorithms.

As to where they differ, an experienced programmer knows that their syntactical differences are minor compared to their conceptual similarities. However, R admittedly has a greater ability to handle and manipulate large datasets, while MATLAB can apply the theories of linear algebra far better than R. A near-comprehensive comparison between the two languages can be found here in a PDF from the University of Maine.

Letâ€™s begin to see how MATLAB can be used to gain insight about the nature of our world through mathematical models and computation.
